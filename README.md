## Overview

This project is a **Decentralized Exchange (DEX)** built as a portfolio showcase to demonstrate knowledge of full-stack Web3 development.  
It implements a simplified **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** model, similar to Uniswap V2, where users can:

- Swap between two ERC-20 tokens
- Provide and withdraw liquidity
- Earn LP tokens representing their share in the pool
- See real-time pool statistics and token prices

The goal of this project is to highlight strong fundamentals in smart contract design, frontend dApp integration, and modern Web3 tooling. It was built with **performance, clean code, and scalability** in mind.
